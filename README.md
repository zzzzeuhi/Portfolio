It's like a song that no one hears
I'm screaming out but you're not here
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
Is say I love you
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
Is say I care
Words don't work
Feeling like they have no worth
Here and now
There's nothing in between
How could I
Ever describe the way I feel
Why should I, even try
When obviously all the words that I say
Seem to get in my way
Only wish I could
Say it with a heartbeat
Say it with a
It's like a stage without a crowd
  
  My best performance
But no one's proud
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
Is say I love you
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
> Is say I care
I swear my words don't work
Feeling like they have no worth
Here and now there's nothing in between
No Ooh oooh
How could I ever describe the way I feel
Why should I even try
When obviously all the words that
seem to get in my way only wish I could
Say it with a heartbeat
Say it with a
Say it with a heartbeat
Say it with a heartbeat
